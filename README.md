# 🍷 White Wine Quality Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **White Wine Quality Dataset**.  
The goal is to understand how different **physicochemical properties** influence the quality of white wine using **Python data analysis and visualization techniques**.

The analysis helps identify important features affecting wine quality and provides insights that can be useful for **quality prediction models**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **4898 white wine samples** with the following attributes:

- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (target variable)

**Target Variable:** `Quality` (rated from 3 to 9)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **descriptive statistical analysis**
- Identify **key factors affecting wine quality**
- Visualize data using **heatmaps and plots**
- Understand correlations between features
- Prepare data for future **machine learning models**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling and understanding numerical features
- Statistical summary using `describe()`
- Correlation analysis
- Heatmap visualization
- Feature-wise observations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The **average wine quality** is around **5.87**, indicating mostly medium-quality wines.
- **Alcohol content** shows a positive relationship with wine quality.
- **Volatile acidity** negatively impacts quality.
- **Sulphates** contribute slightly to better quality.
- **Free and total sulfur dioxide** levels vary widely, reflecting different preservation techniques.
- Most wines are rated between **5 and 7**.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Wine quality is influenced by a **combination of chemical properties**, not a single factor.  
Among all attributes, **alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates** play an important role in determining quality.  
This dataset is well-suited for **regression and classification models** to predict wine quality.
